Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks.

At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as **agentic systems**, but draw an important architectural distinction between **workflows** and **agents**:\n\n* **Workflows** are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.\n* **Agents**, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.\n\nBelow, we will explore both types of agentic systems in detail. In Appendix 1 (“Agents in Practice”), we describe two domains where customers have found particular value in using these kinds of systems.\n\n## When (and when not) to use agents\n\nWhen building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed.

Agentic systems often trade latency and cost for better task performance, and you should consider when this tradeoff makes sense.\n\nWhen more complexity is warranted, workflows offer predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks, whereas agents are the better option when flexibility and model-driven decision-making are needed at scale. For many applications, however, optimizing single LLM calls with retrieval and in-context examples is usually enough.\n\n## When and how to use frameworks\n\nThere are many frameworks that make agentic systems easier to implement, including:\n\n* [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) from LangChain;\n* Amazon Bedrock's [AI Agent framework](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/);\n* [Rivet](https://rivet.ironcladapp.com/), a drag and drop GUI LLM workflow builder; and\n* [Vellum](https://www.vellum.ai/), another GUI tool for building and testing complex workflows.\n\nThese frameworks make it easy to get started by simplifying standard low-level tasks like calling LLMs, defining and parsing tools, and chaining calls together. However, they often create extra layers of abstraction that can obscure the underlying prompts ​​and responses, making them harder to debug. They can also make it tempting to add complexity when a simpler setup would suffice.\n\nWe suggest that developers start by using LLM APIs directly: many patterns can be implemented in a few lines of code.

We'll start with our foundational building block—the augmented LLM—and progressively increase complexity, from simple compositional workflows to autonomous agents.\n\n### Building block: The augmented LLM\n\nThe basic building block of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory.

Consistently, the most successful implementations weren't using complex frameworks or specialized libraries. Instead, they were building with simple, composable patterns.\n\nIn this post, we share what we’ve learned from working with our customers and building agents ourselves, and give practical advice for developers on building effective agents.\n\n## What are agents?\n\n\"Agent\" can be defined in several ways. Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks. Others use the term to describe more prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows. At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as **agentic systems**, but draw an important architectural distinction between **workflows** and **agents**:\n\n* **Workflows** are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.\n* **Agents**, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.\n\nBelow, we will explore both types of agentic systems in detail. In Appendix 1 (“Agents in Practice”), we describe two domains where customers have found particular value in using these kinds of systems.\n\n## When (and when not) to use agents\n\nWhen building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed. This might mean not building agentic systems at all. Agentic systems often trade latency and cost for better task performance, and you should consider when this tradeoff makes sense.\n\nWhen more complexity is warranted, workflows offer predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks, whereas agents are the better option when flexibility and model-driven decision-making are needed at scale. For many applications, however, optimizing single LLM calls with retrieval and in-context examples is usually enough.\n\n## When and how to use frameworks\n\nThere are many frameworks that make agentic systems easier to implement, including:\n\n* [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) from LangChain;\n* Amazon Bedrock's [AI Agent framework](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/);\n* [Rivet](https://rivet.ironcladapp.com/), a drag and drop GUI LLM workflow builder; and\n* [Vellum](https://www.vellum.ai/), another GUI tool for building and testing complex workflows.\n\nThese frameworks make it easy to get started by simplifying standard low-level tasks like calling LLMs, defining and parsing tools, and chaining calls together. However, they often create extra layers of abstraction that can obscure the underlying prompts ​​and responses, making them harder to debug. They can also make it tempting to add complexity when a simpler setup would suffice.\n\nWe suggest that developers start by using LLM APIs directly: many patterns can be implemented in a few lines of code. If you do use a framework, ensure you understand the underlying code. Incorrect assumptions about what's under the hood are a common source of customer error.\n\nSee our [cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/patterns/agents) for some sample implementations.\n\n## Building blocks, workflows, and agents\n\nIn this section, we’ll explore the common patterns for agentic systems we’ve seen in production. We'll start with our foundational building block—the augmented LLM—and progressively increase complexity, from simple compositional workflows to autonomous agents.\n\n### Building block: The augmented LLM\n\nThe basic building block of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. Our current models can actively use these capabilities—generating their own search queries, selecting appropriate tools, and determining what information to retain.\n\nWe recommend focusing on two key aspects of the implementation: tailoring these capabilities to your specific use case and ensuring they provide an easy, well-documented interface for your LLM. While there are many ways to implement these augmentations, one approach is through our recently released [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), which allows developers to integrate with a growing ecosystem of third-party tools with a simple [client implementation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/tutorials/building-a-client#building-mcp-clients).\n\nFor the remainder of this post, we'll assume each LLM call has access to these augmented capabilities.\n\n### Workflow: Prompt chaining\n\nPrompt chaining decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. You can add programmatic checks (see \"gate” in the diagram below) on any intermediate steps to ensure that the process is still on track.\n\n**When to use this workflow:** Th\n\n<error>Content truncated.
