Dear [Persona B],

Thank you for your interest in the Junior Product Manager position at our company. We appreciate you taking the time to submit your application.

After careful consideration of your impressive background, including your experience as a Chief Product Officer and your track record of managing substantial investment portfolios and driving significant revenue growth, we feel that this junior position would not be the best match for your level of expertise and experience.

We believe you would be better suited for senior or executive-level product roles that could fully utilize your extensive experience in leading product organizations and managing large-scale operations.

While we cannot move forward with your application for this specific position, we would be very interested in discussing other senior-level opportunities that may arise within our organization that better match your experience level.

Thank you again for your interest in our company.

Best regards,
[Hiring Manager]
